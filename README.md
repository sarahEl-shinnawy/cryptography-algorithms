## 🎮 Game Descriptions:

### 🔑 **1. RSA Algorithm Game** – *by Nourhan ElSheikh*
An educational game that teaches the RSA encryption and decryption process.  
- Shows step-by-step RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- The user is challenged to guess:
  - The encrypted version of a given string.
  - The decrypted version of an RSA ciphertext.

### 🕹️ **2. SHA-256 Algorithm Hangman** – *by Doha Eid*
A twist on the classic hangman game using SHA-256 hashing!  
- The user is prompted with SHA-256 hashes.
- They must guess the correct string that matches the hash.
- An entertaining way to visualize the irreversible nature of hashing.

### 🗺️ **3. Cryptoventure: Diffie-Hellman Game** – *by Reem Ali*
An adventure-style game that teaches the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  
- The player controls a character on a map, exploring different areas.
- In each level, the player finds and exchanges keys to unlock the next stage.
- A creative journey through secure key generation and agreement.

### 🧠 **4. Hill Cipher Game** – *by Sarah El-Shinnawy*
An interactive MCQ-based game for understanding the Hill Cipher.  
- The user selects whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
- The game walks through the mathematical steps (matrix multiplication mod 26).
- Multiple-choice questions test the user's understanding at each stage.

### 🌊 **5. Binary Surfer: DES Encryption Game** – *by Sarah El-Shinnawy*
Ride the waves of encryption using the DES algorithm!  
- The user inputs a string and is guided through DES encryption steps.
- At each stage, the game asks: *"What’s the next step?"*
  - Multiple-choice questions assess understanding.
  - Correct answers apply the step and advance the surfer.
  - Incorrect answers cost the surfer a life!
- A dynamic way to explore the Feistel structure and block cipher logic.
